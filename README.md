The Waiting Room Simulator
===============
This is the AI generated code from ChatGPT-4o for http://thewaitingroomsimulator.com/

The website is hosted on AWS LightSail.

Initial iteration of this was an idea for a new game, then testing if ChatGPT-4o could do all of the coding, image, and sound generation for the game.

Here was itteration 1:

Game Concept and Development

* The user shared a detailed concept for a game titled “Waiting Room Simulator,” which involves endless waiting with monotonous activities, annoying NPCs, a drab environment, mind-numbing mini-games, and pointless notifications.

Initial PHP Game Code

* The user requested PHP code for the game, featuring buttons for activities, mini-games, and checking notifications, with a real-time timer and a static image of the waiting room.

Image Generation

* The user provided an initial image of the waiting room. We generated and improved the image to be more photo-realistic, including NPCs and a picture of the user sitting in the chairs.

Timer and Button Updates

* The PHP code was updated multiple times to fix issues with the timer, ensure the timer started correctly, and handle interactions properly.
* The user requested various button-related changes, including hiding the timer initially, adding a check-in process, and ensuring interactions happened at random intervals.

Sound Integration

* The user provided several MP3 files (sneeze, text, fidget, patient, and music) to be integrated into the game.
* We added functionality to play sounds for NPC interactions and check status, and loop background music upon checking in.

Consistency and Debugging

* We addressed issues with the timer jumping or resetting during interactions.
* Ensured that background music continued playing without interruption when other sounds played.

Final Code Adjustments

* The final PHP and JavaScript code ensured the game started the timer upon check-in, played looping background music, and handled button clicks correctly without affecting the timer or stopping the music.

The final setup provided a consistent user experience with the game mechanics working as intended, including sound effects and background music.
