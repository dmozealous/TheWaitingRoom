The Waiting Room Simulator
===============
This is the AI generated code from ChatGPT-4o for http://thewaitingroomsimulator.com/

The website is hosted on AWS LightSail.

Initial itteration of this was an idea for a new game, then testing if ChatGPT-4o could do all of the coding, image, and sound generation for the game.

Here was itteration 1:
Game Concept and Development

	•	The user shared a detailed concept for a game titled “Waiting Room Simulator,” which involves endless waiting with monotonous activities, annoying NPCs, a drab environment, mind-numbing mini-games, and pointless notifications.

Initial PHP Game Code

	•	The user requested PHP code for the game, featuring buttons for activities, mini-games, and checking notifications, with a real-time timer and a static image of the waiting room.

Image Generation

	•	The user provided an initial image of the waiting room. We generated and improved the image to be more photo-realistic, including NPCs and a picture of the user sitting in the chairs.

Timer and Button Updates

	•	The PHP code was updated multiple times to fix issues with the timer, ensure the timer started correctly, and handle interactions properly.
	•	The user requested various button-related changes, including hiding the timer initially, adding a check-in process, and ensuring interactions happened at random intervals.
