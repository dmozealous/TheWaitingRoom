The Waiting Room Simulator
===============
This is the AI generated code from ChatGPT-4o for http://thewaitingroomsimulator.com/

The website is hosted on AWS LightSail.

The test, ask ChatGPT to come up with an idea for a new game, then test if ChatGPT-4o could do all of the coding, image, and sound generation for the game.

**Here are the results:**
===============

I asked ChatGPT-4o:
> come up with an idea for the worst video game of all time?

**Game Title:** "Waiting Room Simulator"

**Concept:**
The game is set entirely in a drab, poorly lit waiting room. The player takes on the role of a character who is waiting for an indeterminate appointment that never actually happens.

**Gameplay Features:**

1. **Endless Waiting:**
   - The game has no real objective other than to wait. There are no quests, no combat, and no puzzles. The player simply sits in the waiting room, waiting for something that never comes.

2. **Monotonous Activities:**
   - The player can choose from a limited set of activities to pass the time, such as reading outdated magazines, staring at a broken TV, or listening to the same three songs on a loop from a tinny radio.

3. **Annoying NPCs:**
   - Other characters in the waiting room engage in irritating behaviors, such as talking loudly on their phones, sneezing constantly, or fidgeting noisily. Interaction with them is limited and always unproductive.

4. **Drab Environment:**
   - The graphics are intentionally dull, with muted colors and low detail. The environment never changes, no matter how long the player waits.

5. **No Progression:**
   - There are no levels, no skill trees, and no upgrades. The game starts and ends in the same waiting room, with no sense of progression or achievement.

6. **Mind-Numbing Mini-Games:**
   - Occasionally, the player can engage in simple, repetitive mini-games like sorting through old paperwork or untangling a mess of phone cords. These mini-games are designed to be tedious and unrewarding.

7. **Pointless Notifications:**
   - The game regularly provides useless updates, such as "The doctor will see you soon," which never actually lead to any progression.

8. **Real-Time Clock:**
   - The game operates in real-time, meaning a minute in the game is a minute in real life. This extends the feeling of endless waiting and frustration.

**Objective:**
To endure as long as possible without quitting out of sheer boredom or frustration. There is no winning or end goal, making the entire experience futile.

Game Development Iteration 1:
===============
**Total ChatGPT-4o questions and commands to get to initial state:** 28

**Game Concept and Development**

* The user shared a detailed concept for a game titled “Waiting Room Simulator,” which involves endless waiting with monotonous activities, annoying NPCs, a drab environment, mind-numbing mini-games, and pointless notifications.

**Initial PHP Game Code**

* The user requested PHP code for the game, featuring buttons for activities, mini-games, and checking notifications, with a real-time timer and a static image of the waiting room.

**Image Generation**

* The user provided an initial image of the waiting room. We generated and improved the image to be more photo-realistic, including NPCs and a picture of the user sitting in the chairs.

**Timer and Button Updates**

* The PHP code was updated multiple times to fix issues with the timer, ensure the timer started correctly, and handle interactions properly.
* The user requested various button-related changes, including hiding the timer initially, adding a check-in process, and ensuring interactions happened at random intervals.

**Sound Integration**

* The user provided several MP3 files (sneeze, text, fidget, patient, and music) to be integrated into the game.
* We added functionality to play sounds for NPC interactions and check status, and loop background music upon checking in.

**Consistency and Debugging**

* We addressed issues with the timer jumping or resetting during interactions.
* Ensured that background music continued playing without interruption when other sounds played.

**Final Code Adjustments**

* The final PHP and JavaScript code ensured the game started the timer upon check-in, played looping background music, and handled button clicks correctly without affecting the timer or stopping the music.

The final setup provided a consistent user experience with the game mechanics working as intended, including sound effects and background music.

## Summary of Changes and Updates in Iteration 2

After some period of time, the ChatGPT window became so long it was hard to navigate, and successive requests weren't doing what I asked. What I did was start a new chat, provide the PHP file, then asked for bug fixes. This seemed to work fairly well.

**Total ChatGPT-4o questions and commands to get to updated/current state:** 28

### Initial Requests and Changes:
1. **Play Audio on Button Click**:
   - Implemented functionality to play `patient.mp3` when the "Check Status" button is clicked.

2. **CSS Updates**:
   - Added a drab green color to the buttons.
   - Moved CSS to a separate `style.css` file for better organization.

### Audio Playback Issues on iOS:
3. **iOS Audio Playback Fixes**:
   - Ensured audio playback is initiated within user interaction events to comply with iOS restrictions.
   - Added `onclick` events to play music and status sounds correctly.

### Volume Adjustment:
4. **Volume Reduction**:
   - Reduced the volume of the background music to 10% by setting `musicElement.volume = 0.1`.

### Game State Reset on Refresh:
5. **Game Reset on Refresh**:
   - Modified the code to reset the game state every time the page is refreshed, ensuring the user needs to check in again.
